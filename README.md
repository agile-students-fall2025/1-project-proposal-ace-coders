# Project Proposal
**LocalLens – Community Event Finder**
[Sanay Daptardar](https://github.com/sanay-d-nyu)

# What and why?
Communities often host local events (open mics, art fairs, volunteer opportunities, small business promotions), but students and residents miss them because they’re scattered across multiple platforms or flyers.
 
I propose LocalLens, which solves this by aggregating local events into one accessible, user-friendly app where people can browse and filter events relevant to their interests.

# For whom?
The initial end-users would be students and young professionals living at NYU, as well as small local businesses and organizations who want to promote their events. We will test the app by gathering events from NYU and local events in the area.

# How?
### From a user’s perspective:
	•	Users can browse upcoming events in their area through a map view or calendar list.
	•	Filters allow them to sort by category (music, sports, volunteering, food).
	•	Businesses or clubs can post their own events with a simple form.
	•	Users can “follow” certain groups or tags to get event notifications.
	
# Scope
This project is realistic for one semester. Core features (event posting, browsing, filtering, notifications) are enough for an MVP. Integration with external event APIs (like Meetup or Eventbrite) could be optional stretch goals.
